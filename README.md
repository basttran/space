# A sandbox repo for experimenting with babylon js

Code is live [here](https://basttran.github.io/space/)

## Base controls

- load demo 1 (default) : '&'
- load demo 2 : 'é'
- move player: 'z'/'q'/'s'/'d'

(yes, it makes sense with an azerty keyboard)

- jump: ' ' (a.k.a. the space bar)
- rotate view: mouse move
- toggle yAxis inversion : '²'

# Demo 1 :

Close to no interactions available. Exists mostly for working on the 'player' implementation

# Demo 2 :

Exists mostly in order to train with animations/interactions. It is possible to interact with some meshes through pointerdown events.
Examples here are heavily inspired if not copied from [those kindly published](https://github.com/Babylon-Projects/Babylon_101) by [@jgonzosan](https://github.com/jgonzosan) alongside [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLym1B0rdkvqhuCNSXzxw6ofEkrpYI70P4)

# TODO

- refactor/improve existing mechanics (jump, switch demos)
- forces
- animation
- texture bugs
- UI/HUD + loading screen(s)
- and _go beyond_ :muscle:
